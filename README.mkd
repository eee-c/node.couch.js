# node.couch.js

This a repository full of all kinds of CouchDB + node.js goodies. This is not, however, a CouchDB client library.

## changes

To use the changes service:

> cd changes
> node lib/service.js http://127.0.0.1:5984


This will start the service, look for any design documents, and start any change listeners you've defined. It also checks every minute for new databases.

To define a new listener in your design doc:

<pre>
{ ....

"changes":"var sys = require('sys');
           var listener = function (change) {
             sys.puts(JSON.stringify(change));
           }
           exports.listener = listener;",
}
</pre>
